### Shap-e into Unity

Unity Sentis gives us the opportunity to  run AI models in Unity. There are plenty to choose from on Huggingface - and eventually I want to create my own. As a POC I will try to import the shap-e generative 3D model and the whisper speech to text model to enable the user to speak a prompt that will create an object in AR.
